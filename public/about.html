<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a dedicated and adaptable professional with a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering and over two years of professional work experience. After spending three years preparing for competitive government exams, I transitioned into the corporate sector, where I developed discipline, problem-solving abilities, and the resilience to work under pressure. These experiences have strengthened my ability to quickly learn, adapt, and deliver results in dynamic environments.</p>

<p>With a growing passion for technology, I am now pursuing a career transition into the IT industry, focusing on front-end web development. I have been actively upskilling myself in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, while also working on hands-on projects to gain practical expertise. My strong foundation in logical thinking, coupled with consistent self-learning, allows me to approach challenges creatively and effectively.</p>

<p>I am seeking opportunities where I can contribute my technical skills while continuing to grow as a professional. My goal is to secure a work-from-home role in web development or related IT domains, where I can apply my learning, build impactful solutions, and evolve into a skilled developer delivering long-term value.</p>
